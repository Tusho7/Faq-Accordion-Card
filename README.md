## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on page layout,page responsiveness and functionality.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover effects
- Click on questions
- Receive answers on questions

If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices.

## My process

Change background color of body
Add background gradient
Create divs
Add arrows, questions and answers
Give icon sizes and styles in CSS
Create hover effects
add Javascript code to get answers

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile first approach
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- Javascript

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained more practise of using Javascript,  the main challenge that I overcame was to create Js Functionality for the card.After research and practicing different ways for resolving this step, I wrote the Javascript code which worked eventually.

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic, interactive and functional projects
